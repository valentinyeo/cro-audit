# CRO Initiatives for Click Shades

*Example audit report - extracted from PDF*

## 1. Hero Section & "Quintessential" Layout

The current hero skips the fundamental "Landing Page Stack." You need to re-architect the top of the mobile page to follow the standard Shopify power-user pattern.

- **The Main Claim:** Currently, "Find My Car" is taking the spot of the value proposition. You need a bold, readable heading: *"Vehicle-Specific Car Sunshades."*
- **The Sub-Claim:** Add a supporting line or bullet points (which have higher readability) emphasizing the custom fit and ease of use.
- **Visual Fidelity:** Move away from white text on a dark/muddy background. Ensure maximum contrast. If using a background image, use a high-quality, professional shot that clearly shows the product in action, then use a dark overlay or a solid text block to ensure readability.
- **The Squint Test (Logo):** Redesign or re-orient the logo. On mobile, the word "Shades" is too small. Stack the words or increase the font size of the keyword so it's recognizable even when blurred or viewed quickly.

## 2. The "Trust Signal" Offensive

The speaker emphasizes that "Proof is Sales." With only 7 reviews, the site lacks the "overwhelming" social proof required to overcome "scam anxiety."

- **Review Aggregation:** Start pulling in reviews from every possible source (Google Maps, Facebook, eBay). Even if the numbers are small, displaying them builds a "moat of trust."
- **Trust Bar Placement:** Move the star ratings directly under the Main Claim in the hero.
- **The "Store Rating" vs. "Product Rating":** Differentiate between them to maximize the sheer number of stars visible on the page.
- **Incentivization:** Implement an automated flow (potentially via an app like Loox or Judge.me) offering discounts in exchange for photo/video reviews to increase "design sophistication."

## 3. Product Selection Flow (The "Selector" Module)

The "Find My Car" tool is your primary conversion path, but it currently has too much friction.

- **Tighten the Module:** Ensure the selector doesn't look "deselected" or weak. Use stronger visual guidance (arrows, bold borders) on what the user needs to do next.
- **The "Lock-In" Principle:** Once a user selects their car model, **do not make them do it again.** If they navigate away or click the logo to go "home," the site should remember their car and show them a personalized "Home" page for that specific model.
- **Fallback Options:** Add a "Shop by Popular Models" section immediately below the selector for users who don't want to use a dropdown (reducing the "jobs" they have to do).

## 4. Header & Utility Optimization

The small details at the top of the page are currently under-utilized.

- **The "Excessive" Top Banner:** Make the announcement bar (Free Shipping, Same Day Dispatch) taller and more prominent.
- **Rotating Messages:** Instead of three tiny messages, show one large message that rotates. Movement grabs attention and ensures each USP is actually read.
- **Clickable Banner:** Ensure the top banner is a CTA that leads directly to the selector or the best-selling collection.

## 5. Technical Design Sophistication

To compete with "older, more mature" designs, you need to add layers of interactivity and urgency.

- **The "Permanent Sale" & Urgency:** Test a persistent discount (e.g., 10% off for email) and "Low Stock" counters on product pages.
- **Product Gallery Overhaul:** The images are currently too small. Adopt the "Amazon style"—large, high-res images with a sophisticated zoom/modal experience.
- **Proactive Chat:** Implement a chat bubble that triggers a message like "Can't find your car model?" after a few seconds of idling on the selector.
