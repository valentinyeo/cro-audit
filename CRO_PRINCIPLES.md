# CRO Principles Framework

A reference guide for common CRO (Conversion Rate Optimization) principles used during audits. Use these as evaluation criteria when comparing client sites against competitors.

## 1. Hero Section - The "Quintessential" Layout

The hero section is the most critical area. Most conversions are lost here.

### Required Elements (in order)

1. **Logo** - Keyword must be readable (pass the "squint test")
2. **Trust Bar** - Reviews/ratings immediately visible
3. **Main Claim** - Bold value proposition (what you sell + why it matters)
4. **Sub-Claim** - Supporting details (bullet points have higher readability)
5. **Primary CTA** - Clear action button
6. **Hero Image** - High-quality product in context

### Common Mistakes

- Using a tool/selector as the main claim (e.g., "Find My Car" instead of "Vehicle-Specific Sunshades")
- White text on dark/muddy backgrounds (poor contrast)
- Logo with unreadable keywords on mobile
- Missing trust signals above the fold

### The Squint Test

Blur or squint at the page. Can you still identify:
- What the site sells?
- The brand name?
- Where to click?

## 2. Trust Signals - "Proof is Sales"

Overcome "scam anxiety" with overwhelming social proof.

### Trust Signal Types

| Signal | Placement | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Star Rating | Under main claim | Most important |
| Review Count | Next to stars | Higher = better |
| Store Rating | Header/trust bar | Aggregate from all sources |
| Product Rating | Product pages | Specific to item |
| Platform Badges | Footer/trust bar | Google, Facebook, eBay, etc. |
| Payment Icons | Footer/checkout | Visa, PayPal, etc. |

### Trust Signal Sources

Aggregate reviews from everywhere:
- Google Maps / Google Business
- Facebook Page
- eBay Store
- Trustpilot
- Platform-specific (Shopify, Amazon)

### Review Collection Strategy

- Automated post-purchase flows (Loox, Judge.me)
- Discount incentives for photo/video reviews
- Follow-up emails requesting reviews
- Make it easy (direct links, QR codes)

---

## 3. Product Selection Flow

If you have a selector/configurator, it must be frictionless.

### Principles

- **Visual Guidance**: Bold borders, arrows, clear indication of current step
- **Lock-In**: Remember selections (don't make users repeat choices)
- **Fallback Options**: "Shop by Popular Models" for users who won't use selector
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Only show next step after previous is complete
- **No Empty CTAs**: Don't show "Add to Cart" until product is selected

### The "Jobs" Concept

Every dropdown/input = a "job" for the user. Each job loses people.
- Minimize required jobs
- Make each job as easy as possible
- Provide shortcuts (popular options, recent selections)

---

## 4. Header & Announcement Bar

The top of page is prime real estate.

### Announcement Bar Best Practices

- **Size**: Make it "excessively" tall - bigger works better
- **Rotation**: Single large message that rotates (movement grabs attention)
- **Content**: Free shipping, dispatch time, guarantees, current sale
- **Clickable**: Link to best-selling collection or selector

### Header Elements

- Hamburger menu (can include "Menu" text)
- Logo (readable on mobile)
- Cart icon with count
- Search (optional, depends on catalog size)

---

## 5. Design Sophistication

Compete with "older, more mature" designs through polish and interactivity.

### Urgency Elements

- **Countdown timers**: Sale ends in X:XX:XX
- **Stock counters**: "Only 18 left" (can be dynamic/random)
- **Dispatch cutoffs**: "Order in next 2 hours for same-day shipping"

### Product Gallery (Amazon Style)

- Large, high-resolution images
- Zoom on hover/click
- Modal/lightbox experience
- Multiple angles and context shots
- Lifestyle images showing product in use

### Interactive Elements

- **Proactive Chat**: Trigger after idle time ("Can't find your car model?")
- **Exit Intent**: Discount popup when leaving
- **Scroll Triggers**: Reveal elements as user scrolls

### The "Permanent Sale"

- Always-on discount (10-15% for email signup)
- Creates urgency without time pressure
- Test for fatigue with repeat visitors

---

## 6. Mobile Optimization

Mobile is often 60-80% of traffic. Prioritize mobile experience.

### Mobile-Specific Checks

- Logo keyword readable at small size
- Touch targets large enough (44px minimum)
- Forms easy to fill (appropriate keyboard types)
- Images not cropped awkwardly
- CTAs visible without scrolling
- No horizontal scroll

### Mobile Hero Stack

```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│    Announcement Bar     │  ← Rotating messages
├─────────────────────────┤
│  Logo    [≡]    [Cart]  │
├─────────────────────────┤
│      ★★★★★ (2,847)      │  ← Trust signal
├─────────────────────────┤
│                         │
│      MAIN CLAIM         │  ← Big, bold, readable
│      Sub-claim text     │
│                         │
│    [ Primary CTA ]      │
│                         │
│     [Product Image]     │
│                         │
└─────────────────────────┘
```
